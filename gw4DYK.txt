Did You Know 7:
  1. act, getActors, processActors, getMoveLocations, selectMoveLocation, makeMove
  2. getActors, processActors, getMoveLocations, selectMoveLocation, makeMov
  3. yes, if the new subclass takes actors from different positions than Critter doees
  4. a)tell them to move forward one space b)change their color c)remove them all
  5. a)getMoveLocations - returns the places the critter can move
     b)selectMoveLocation - selects one of the locations from getMoveLocations 
     c)makeMove - moves the Critter to the location selected in selectMoveLocation
  6. Critter has no constructor because it is a subclass of Actor, which already has a default constructor

Did You Know 8:
1. In ChameleonCritter, processActors() is overridden and different from that of Critter. This makes the ChameleonCritter process the actors differently from a Critter.
2. The makeMove method calls super.makeMove because the ChameleonCritter behaves the same way as a Critter after it changes its direction when moving to a new location.
3. You would make ChameleonCritter drop flowers in its old location when it moves by adding statements in makeMove() that keep track of the critter's old location and create a flower in that old location after the critter has moved.
4. ChameleonCritter doesn't override the getActors() method because it accesses the same actors that a Critter does, so there is no need to modify the method.
5. The Actor class contains the getLocation() method, and ChameleonCritter inherits this.
6. A Critter can access its own grid by calling getGrid().
