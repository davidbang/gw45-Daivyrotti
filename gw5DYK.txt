Do You Know?
Set 10
  1. isValid is specified in the Grid interface. BoundedGrid and UnboundedGrid implement isValid.
  2. getValidAdjacentLocations calls isValid. Other methods don't directly call isValid but rather call getValidAdjacentLocations, thereby indirectly calling isValid.
  3. getNeighbors calls get and getOccupiedAdjacentLocations, the latter implemented in AbstractGrid and the former in BoundedGrid and UnboundedGrid
  4. get must be used in getEmptyAdjacentLocations because it is the only way to test the vacantness of a location
  5. the diagonal locations would not be included, therefore there are only 4 valid spaces to move rather than 8
