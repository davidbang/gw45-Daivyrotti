Do You Know?
Set 10
  1. isValid is specified in the Grid interface. BoundedGrid and UnboundedGrid implement isValid.
  2. getValidAdjacentLocations calls isValid. Other methods don't directly call isValid but rather call getValidAdjacentLocations, thereby indirectly calling isValid.
  3. getNeighbors calls get and getOccupiedAdjacentLocations, the latter implemented in AbstractGrid and the former in BoundedGrid and UnboundedGrid
  4. get must be used in getEmptyAdjacentLocations because it is the only way to test the vacantness of a location
  5. the diagonal locations would not be included, therefore there are only 4 valid spaces to move rather than 8

Do You Know?
Set 11
  1. the constructor of BoundedGrid will throw an error if there is no valid location
  2. occupantArray[0].length. This based on the assumption that there is a valid location/number of columns
  3. in order to be valid, a location must have a row >= 0 and < the number of rows, and a column >= 0 and < the number of columns.
  4. getOccupiedLocations returns an ArrayList<Location>. O(r*c)
  5. get returns E, or whichever type is being used. get requires a Location. O(1)
  6. an invalid location will throw an error in put. O(1) 
  7. remove returns a generic E. When you are remove a nonexistent actor from an empty location, null is returned. O(1)
  8. This implementation is efficient because 3/4 methods run with a O(1) runtime.
